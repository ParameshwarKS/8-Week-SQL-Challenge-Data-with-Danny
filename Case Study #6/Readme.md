<h2>üìå Introduction</h2>

<h3>üêü Clique Bait ‚Äì E-Commerce Funnel Analysis</h3>

<p>
Clique Bait is not your typical online seafood store. Its founder and CEO, Danny, brings a background in digital data analytics and is combining his expertise with a passion for the seafood industry.
</p>

<p>
This case study challenges you to support Danny's vision by analyzing the Clique Bait e-commerce dataset and developing creative, data-driven solutions.
</p>

<p>
Your primary focus will be on calculating <strong>funnel fallout rates</strong> ‚Äî tracking customer activity throughout the online purchase process and identifying where and why potential sales may be dropping off.
</p>

<h2>üß© Problem Statement</h2>

Danny, with prior experience as a data scientist, understood the importance of data collection in driving business growth. To support this, he designed a relational database and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to structure and manage the data effectively.

While the initial database design is in place, he now requires assistance with:

- Data cleaning and transformation

- Basic analytical calculations

- Operational performance analysis

These steps will help him better direct his delivery runners and optimize overall operations at Pizza Runner.

<h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Digital Analysis</h3>

<p>Using the available datasets, answer each question with a single SQL query:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How many users are there?</li>
  <li>How many cookies does each user have on average?</li>
  <li>What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?</li>
  <li>What is the number of events for each event type?</li>
  <li>What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?</li>
  <li>What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?</li>
  <li>What are the top 3 pages by number of views?</li>
  <li>What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?</li>
  <li>What are the top 3 products by number of purchases?</li>
</ol>

<h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Product Funnel Analysis</h3>

<p>
Using a single SQL query, create a new output table with the following metrics for each product:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of times each product was viewed</li>
  <li>Number of times each product was added to cart</li>
  <li>Number of times each product was added to cart but not purchased (abandoned)</li>
  <li>Number of times each product was purchased</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, generate another aggregated output table with the same metrics grouped by <strong>product category</strong>.</p>

<p>Use these two tables to answer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Which product had the most views, cart adds, and purchases?</li>
  <li>Which product was most likely to be abandoned?</li>
  <li>Which product had the highest view-to-purchase percentage?</li>
  <li>What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?</li>
  <li>What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?</li>
</ol>

<h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Campaigns Analysis</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Compare users who received campaign impressions vs. those who did not</li>
  <li>Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?</li>
