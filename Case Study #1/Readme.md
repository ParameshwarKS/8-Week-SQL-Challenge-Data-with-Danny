<h2>ðŸ“Œ Introduction</h2>

<p>
Danny is a huge fan of Japanese cuisine. At the beginning of 2021, he opened a small and cozy restaurant called <strong>Dannyâ€™s Diner</strong>, serving his top three favorite dishes: <strong>sushi</strong>, <strong>curry</strong>, and <strong>ramen</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To better understand his customers and improve business performance, Danny has collected some basic operational data. This repository explores that data to extract insights and help Danny make data-driven decisions to grow his restaurant.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§© Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
Danny wants to explore his restaurant's data to answer a few key questions about his customers â€” particularly their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. By gaining these insights, he hopes to build a deeper connection with his customers and offer a more personalized dining experience for his most loyal patrons.
</p>

<p>
He plans to use this analysis to decide whether expanding the current customer loyalty program would be beneficial. Additionally, he needs help generating some basic datasets so that his team can inspect the data easily without relying on SQL.
</p>

<p>
Due to privacy concerns, Danny has provided only a sample of his overall customer data. However, he hopes that this sample is sufficient for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help answer his business questions.
