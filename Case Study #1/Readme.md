<h2>ðŸ“Œ Introduction</h2>

<p>
Danny is a huge fan of Japanese cuisine. At the beginning of 2021, he opened a small and cozy restaurant called <strong>Dannyâ€™s Diner</strong>, serving his top three favorite dishes: <strong>sushi</strong>, <strong>curry</strong>, and <strong>ramen</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To better understand his customers and improve business performance, Danny has collected some basic operational data. This repository explores that data to extract insights and help Danny make data-driven decisions to grow his restaurant.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§© Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
Danny wants to explore his restaurant's data to answer a few key questions about his customers â€” particularly their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. By gaining these insights, he hopes to build a deeper connection with his customers and offer a more personalized dining experience for his most loyal patrons.
</p>

<p>
He plans to use this analysis to decide whether expanding the current customer loyalty program would be beneficial. Additionally, he needs help generating some basic datasets so that his team can inspect the data easily without relying on SQL.
</p>

<p>
Due to privacy concerns, Danny has provided only a sample of his overall customer data. However, he hopes that this sample is sufficient for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help answer his business questions.
</p>

<p>
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
<ul>
  <li><code>sales</code></li>
  <li><code>menu</code></li>
  <li><code>members</code></li>
</ul>
Below is the entity relationship diagram for the data provided:

<h2>ðŸ“š Case Study Questions</h2>

<p>Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
  <li>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
  <li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
  <li>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
  <li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
  <li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
  <li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
  <li>What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
  <li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
  <li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
</ol>
