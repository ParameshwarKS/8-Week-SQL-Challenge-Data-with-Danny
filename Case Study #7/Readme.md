Balanced Tree Clothing Company is a modern fashion and lifestyle brand that caters to adventurers and trendsetters alike. The company takes pride in delivering a well-curated, optimized range of products for its customers.

Danny, the CEO, has requested support from the data team to assist the merchandising department in analyzing sales performance and preparing a basic financial report. The goal is to provide clear insights that can be shared with key stakeholders across the business.

<h2>🧩 Problem Statement</h2>

Danny, with prior experience as a data scientist, understood the importance of data collection in driving business growth. To support this, he designed a relational database and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to structure and manage the data effectively.

While the initial database design is in place, he now requires assistance with:

- Data cleaning and transformation

- Basic analytical calculations

- Operational performance analysis

<h2>📚 Case Study Questions</h2>

These business questions represent key performance indicators that the Balanced Tree Clothing Company team uses for monthly financial and merchandising reporting.

Each question can be answered using a single SQL query, but consider how all queries might be combined into a reusable script for automated reporting.
